## About Me

My name is Lucas, I'm a computer science student (7/9) and a back-end software developer at [GoLedger](https://goledger.com.br/), working with blockchain technology. Currently I study and work so I can improve myself both as a person and a professional, and reach out for what I want for me and those I love.

Some trivia about me:
* My favorite food is pizza
* I love motorcycles, but don't even know how to ride a bike
* I have no talent for music, but I like Metal and Acid Jazz
* I listen to 80s japanese city pop music while coding
* I'm a intermediate level cooker (knows how to follow a recipe, but not always it works well)
* I have a boardgame collection with my fiancee, but no friends to play with
* I really like RPG, racing and fighting videogames
* I like to memorize keyboard shortcuts
* My favorite movies are Blade Runner 2049, The Northman and Mononoke Hime

## What I do

At work, my obligations are based on developing and maintain APIs, smart contracts and containerized applications, all written mainly in Go Programming Language. As a project manager, I have to plan and design a project's requirements and guarantee client products's delivery with success and punctuality. We have some big clients in Brazil, some using our products in production daily. The following is the technology stack we usually work with:
